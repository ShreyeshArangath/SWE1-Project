# Git Basics 

## Basic flow to push your changes to Remote (Github)
```
git add .
git commit -m "<message>"
git push origin <branch_name>
```

Create pull request once you're happy with the changes. 

## How to update your local copy with the changes made on main? 
Note: Do this often (once in a couple of days)
```
git pull origin main
```
If prompted with a weird screen with text, try pressing esc and type `:wq`
